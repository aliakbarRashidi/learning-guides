How to store global data
========================

For storing global data, you would need a :ref:`Stateless Javascript library<stateless_javascript_library>`. Once you have created a stateless Javascript file, then you can store global variables and data in that file.

.. code-block:: js

    //my_stateless_js_file

    var data = ['data1', 'data2']
