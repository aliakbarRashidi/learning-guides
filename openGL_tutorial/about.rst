About this Tutorial
===================

Why Would You Want to Read this Guide?
--------------------------------------

This tutorial provides a basic introduction to OpenGL and 3D computer graphics. It shows how to make use of Qt and its OpenGL related classes to create 3D graphics by using OpenGL's programmable pipeline. The tutorial provides many examples that demonstrate the basic features of OpenGL programming such as rendering, texture mapping, lighting, and so on. By the end of the tutorial, you will have a good understanding about how OpenGL works and you will also be able to write custom shader programs.
