About this Guide
================

Why Would You Want to Read this Guide?
--------------------------------------

The goal of this guide is to inform you about the best programming practices using the Canvas type in Qt Quick 2.0.
A prerequisite to this guide is to have a solid understanding of the QML language, so I recommend reading the Qt Quick Application Development Primer first to understand how to use Qt Quick for application development. Throughout this guide, weâ€™ll walk you through various aspects and examples of Qt Quick 2.0 Painting API with Canvas. References to other information sources are provided to make it easy for you to deepen your understanding of the used API.
