Conclusion
==========

In this tutorial, we explored some of the capabilities of the Qt Quick Canvas type. We developed a nice looking pie chart visualization and ported HTML5 Canvas code to Qt Quick. If you want to learn more about the canvas API, you can refer to some of the HTML5 tutorials available on the internet.
