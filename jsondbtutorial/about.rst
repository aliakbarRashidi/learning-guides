About this Guide
================

Why Would You Want to Read this Guide?
--------------------------------------

The goal of this tutorial is to make you familiar with best programming practices using the QtJsonDb API in Qt Quick 2.0 as part of Qt 5.
A prerequisite to this tutorial is to have a solid understanding of the QML language and also use the Qt Quick Application Development Primer as your first guide on how to use Qt Quick for application development. Throughout this tutorial, weâ€™ll walk you through various aspects and an example of QtJsonDb API. References to other information sources are provided to make it easy for you to deepen your understanding of the used API.

.. Note:: QtJsonDb module is not part of the Qt 5 Alpha release and so you would need to compile Qt 5 and the QtJsonDb module yourself by cloning it from the Git repository. Check this `Building Qt 5 from Git <http://qt-project.org/wiki/Building_Qt_5_from_Git>`_ wiki page for detailed information.
