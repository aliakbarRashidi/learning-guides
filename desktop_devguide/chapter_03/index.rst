Implementing the UI and Adding Functionality
============================================

The initial prototype has introduced the basis of our UI and concepts of NoteApp* functionality, and helped us identify which QML Component is needed.

Based on the prototype, we will try to build a working application reaching towards a more complete UI with some working functionality. Now, we will start composing the application's UI using the components we have implemented so far.

This chapter will cover detailed steps about using graphics with QML, images and backgrounds, enhancing the UI, and also about adding functionality using Javascript. You will have a chance to dive deeper into some QML types and also get introduced to new ones while slightly increasing the level of code complexity as we continue to implement functionality.

.. note::

    You will find the implementation related to this chapter in the zip file provided in the :ref:`get-source-code` section.


These are the main points covered in this chapter:

    * Managing `Page` elements by introducing the *PagePanel* component and by using the `Repeater` element

    * Using graphics with QML

    * Inline Javascript code for enhancing the UI and adding functionality

    * Diving deeper into the QML types that we are currently using

This chapter has the following steps:
