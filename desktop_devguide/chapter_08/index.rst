Lesson Learned and Further Reading
==================================

This guide has shown you how to create an application using Qt Quick and how to make it ready for deployment onto a desktop environment. We have seen how to develop the NoteApp* application step-by-step and we have learned various aspects of the QML language and its potential for developing modern fluid UIs while keeping the code clean, simple by applying various programming techniques.

We have learned some of the best practices of using various QML types and covered some interesting topics such as:

    * Animations and States

    * Using JavaScript to enhance functionality

    * Dynamic QML object management

    * Local database storage

    * Making the application ready to deploy.

By now, you should have the necessary knowledge and confidence to further enhance NoteApp* with features and UI improvements, and explore more features of QML and Qt Quick that we haven't had a chance to cover in this guide.

Qt Quick is a fast growing technology that is being adopted by various software development industries and areas, so it would be helpful to refer to the Qt Documentation page for latest update about this technology.
