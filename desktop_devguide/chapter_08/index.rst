Lesson Learned and Further Reading
==================================

This guide has shown you how to create an application using Qt Quick and how to make it ready for deployment onto a desktop environment.We have seen how to develop the     NoteApp* application step by step and we have learned various aspects of QML language and its potential for developing modern fluid UIs while keeping the code clean, simple and applying various programming techniques.

We have learned some of the best practices of using various QML Elements and covered some interesting topics such as:

     Animations and States
     Using Javascript to enhance functionality
     Dynamic QML object management
     Local Database storage
     Making the application ready to deploy.

By now, you should have the necessary knowledge and confidence to further enhance     NoteApp* with features and UI improvements and explore more features of QML and Qt Quick that we haven't had a chance to cover in this guide.

Qt Quick is a fast growing technology being adopted by various software development industries and areas so it would be quite helpful to refer to the Qt Documentation page for new upcoming features.
