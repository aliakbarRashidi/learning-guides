Enhancing the Look and Feel
===========================

The NoteApp's* UI can be considered complete in terms of functionality and user interaction. However, there is plenty of room for improvement by making the UI more appealing to the user. QML was designed as a declarative language, keeping in mind the animations and fluid transitions of UI elements.

In this chapter, we will guide you step-by-step on how to add animations and make NoteApp* feel more fluid. QML provides a set of QML types that enable you to implement animations in a more convenient approach. This chapter introduces new types and guides how to use them in our QML Components to make the UI more fluid.
