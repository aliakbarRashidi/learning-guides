Adding Animations and Enhancing the Look & Feel
===============================================

    NoteApp's* UI can be considered complete in terms of functionality and user interaction. There is, however, plenty of room for improvement by making the UI more appealing to the user. QML as a declarative language was implemented with animations and fluid transitions of UI elements in mind.

In this chapter, we will guide you step by step on how to add animations and make     NoteApp* feel more fluid. QML provides a set of QML elements that enable you to implement animations in a more convenient approach. This chapter will introduce new elements and how these elements will be used in our QML Components in order to make the UI more fluid.
