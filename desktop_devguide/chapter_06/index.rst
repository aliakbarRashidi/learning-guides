Further Improvements
====================

At this stage, we can consider that the NoteApp* features are complete and the UI also matches *NoteApp*'s requirements. Nevertheless, there is always room for further improvements, which could be minor but they make the application more polished and ready for deployment.

In this chapter, we will go through the minor improvements that are implemented for NoteApp*, but also suggest new ideas and features to be added. Certainly, we would like to encourage everyone to take the     NoteApp* code base and develop it further and perhaps redesign the entire UI and introduce new features.
