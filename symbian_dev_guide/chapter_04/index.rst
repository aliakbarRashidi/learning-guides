Storing Data and Adding Pages
=============================

In the two previous chapters, we have seen how to use the Qt Quick Component for Symbian^3 to build a simple prototype. This chapter details the steps needed to make an almost complete version of our `TodoList` application. We will add some extra functionality for adding, editing and deleting an item from the list. Also we will replace the JavaScript test data with data from a persistent store based on the :qt:`Offline Storage API <qdeclarativeglobalobject.html#offline-storage-api>`.

.. note::

    You will find the implementation related to this chapter in the `Todolist_complete_src.zip` file provided in the :ref:`get-source-code` section.
