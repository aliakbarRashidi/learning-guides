Porting to N9
-------------

In this chapter, you will learn how to port the `TodoList` application on the Nokia N9 MeeGo/Harmattan device using Qt Quick Components for MeeGo/Harmattan. The porting is split into two steps: first we explain how to set up your environment using Qt Creator on Linux and then we will go through the main changes required.

.. note::

    You will find the implementation related to this chapter in the `todolist_meego_src.zip` file provided in the :ref:`get-source-code` section.
