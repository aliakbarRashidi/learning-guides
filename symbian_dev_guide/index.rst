Programming with Qt Quick for Symbian and MeeGo Harmattan Devices
=================================================================

Let's learn by example!

The goal of this guide is to familiarize you with programming with Qt for the Symbian^3 API plus an overview of using MeeGo Harmattan Components. Throughout this guide, weâ€™ll be walking you through the creation of a todo list application from ground up and how to deploy the application to your mobile device. Wherever suitable, we'll provide references to other sources of information to make it easy for you to deepen your understanding of the programming model.

We'll assume you already have `Qt SDK <http://qt.nokia.com/downloads>`_  installed and have a basic understanding of :qt:`Qt <index.html>` and :qt:`Qt Quick <qml-intro.html>` as well as how to use the :creator:`Qt Creator IDE <index.html>`.
