Finalizing the Application User Interface
=========================================

By completing the previous chapters of this guide, you should have learned enough about the fundamentals of using QML components to get a general understanding of how to use them for Symbian^3. Throughout the steps of this chapter, we will walk you though your own implementation of some extra functionality in order to make the application more appealing. In the .zip file containing the source code, you will find an implementation that you can compare to your code.

.. note::

    You will find the implementation related to this chapter in the `todolist_final_src.zip` file provided in the :ref:`get-source-code` section.
