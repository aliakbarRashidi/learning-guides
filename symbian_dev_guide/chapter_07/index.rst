Lessons Learned and Further Reading
===================================

This guide has shown how to build a Symbian based mobile application using QML and QML Components for Symbian^3 and how to port it to N9 using Meego/Harmattan Components.

Throughout the development of our     todolist* application, we have learned many useful aspects of mobile applications such as page navigation, database connections, page states, animations and so on. This shows the possibilities offered by QML for mobile application development.

The goal of this guide was to show you how easy it is to use QML in mobile application development so we assume that you now possess the knowledge necessary to extend the final version for further use or to add more functionality.

If you have any comments of questions related to this guide, please feel free to contact us.

Voila! Enjoy QML!
