Prototyping the Application
===========================

Once we have successfully set up our environment and discovered the basic elements of a Qt Quick Symbian application, we start by describing the concept of our application followed by the implementation of our prototype.

The prototype is a simple implementation of the     TodoList*. It aims at identifying the key components used in the application UI and provides an overview of how our application should behave.

In order to easily follow the steps of this guide, a skeleton project is provided. It contains the starting point of this chapter. If you want to create a new project on your own, please make sure to select a Qt Quick project using Symbian^3 Components.

.. note::

    You will find a skeleton code in `todolist_skeleton_src.zip` file to help you start writing your own code. In addition a prototype implementation related to this chapter is provided in the `todolist_prototyping_src.zip` file so that you can compare to your code. Please refer to the :ref:`get-source-code` section.
