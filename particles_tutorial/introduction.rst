About this Tutorial
===================

Why Would You Want to Read this Guide?
--------------------------------------

The goal of this tutorial is to introduce you to some of the features of Qt Quick 2 for implementing animations and graphic effects. Mainly, this tutorial provides an overview of how to use the `Particles` module in Qt Quick 2 as well as `ShaderEffects` for advanced graphic effects.

The tutorial is split into three main chapters. In the first chapter, you will be introduced to the `Particles` module. We will provide some basic setup code illustrating the use of the main types. The second chapter provides a quick overview of how to use `Shader` programs within QML through a simple example. The last chapter will focus on implementing a demo application step-by-step using `Animations`, `Particles`, and `Shaders`.
