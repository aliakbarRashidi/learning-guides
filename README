General
--------

These guides and tutorials are meant to familiarize you with various aspects of mobile
as well as desktop application development by walking you through the development process of applications with features relevant to the topics of each specific guide.
Each guide is split into several chapters and each chapter consists of multiple steps.
Each step describes specific features of the application, the development approach and
detailed code used for the application being implemented in the guide.

The the content is currently published under following link:

http://qt-project.org/wiki/Developer-Guides

We invite all interested members of the Qt community to contribute to this project.


Installing Sphinx
-----------------

These guides and tutorials are written using the Sphinx tool.

You can read detailed instruction on how to install Sphinx on your system by reading
its documentation http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

In Ubuntu you can install Sphinx like this:

sudo apt-get install python-sphinx
sudo apt-get install texlive

Note: Please make sure to have all the related texlive-latex-extra packages and additionally the texlive-extra-utils, texlive-font-utils and texlive-fonts-* related packages installed.


Building the guides and tutorials
---------------------------------

Once you have Sphinx installed properly then you can go in each of the folder of the guides and run

"make html" - to make standalone HTML files
"make epub" - to make an epub
"make latexpdf" - to make LaTeX files and run them through pdflatex
"make qthelp" - to make HTML files and a qthelp project

A _build directory will be created that will contain the generated format of the content (html, epub, pdf, qthelp).

Only "make html" is currently supported when building from the root folder of the project. This creates a master html content set for all guides. It can be used in automated builds for internal team work.


Source code
-----------

In most cases all the chapters will have some code example that you can see.
However, to get the complete entire code of the guide/tutorial you can either get it inside a "src" folder if one exists or inside the last chapter.
