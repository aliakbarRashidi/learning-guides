Punctuation
===========

This page provides guidelines for proper punctuation in documentation.

Periods
-------

     End sentences in proper punctuation

     Bullet points and admissions should not end in punctuation. Exceptions include sentences ending in prostheses, closing brackets, question marks and quotation marks. Bullet points may end in colons to introduce second, third etc level points. If several sentences follow a bullet point, end all of the sentences in proper puctuation except for the last


The Comma
---------

Commas should follow dependent clauses that come before independent clauses in the same sentence. You'll need to read a bit to get a general idea of how not to over-punctuate. One way to avoid this is by placing the dependent clauses after your independent clauses.

     Use of the comma in the english language can be a bit tricky. You need to become familiar with the following:

      Dependent versus independent clauses (most important!!!):

       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_clause ; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_clause

       Adverb clauses (also called adverbial clauses): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverbial_clause

      Relative clauses: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_clause

      Conditional Sentences

      Noun Clauses

      Adjective Clauses (also called relative clauses)

     This is a relatively short, yet good, overview of when to use and not use commas: http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/607/02/
